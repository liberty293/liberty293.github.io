For decades, each “new wave” of lab technology—computers, XR, now generative AI—has promised transformation. Yet many spaces remain full of abandoned pilots and one-off demos. This study flips the lens: instead of evaluating technologies in isolation, it centers experts' voices about what actually helps people reason through experiential learning experiences.

Through site visits, surveys, and follow-up interviews with expert instructors for experimental learning labs, we surfaced the tensions that derail adoption and translated them into design guidelines for deployable tools.

## Key Findings

Hands-on labs remain irreplaceable for building shared intuition. Virtual-only replicas are safer and cheaper, but can be unrealistic, unengaging, and poor at cultivating necessary psychomotor skills. The ideal space for technology is augmentation, not replacement. Simulations that hide variability and messiness of realistic scenarios can lead to a false sense of understanding. Instead, allowing technology to expose and quantify realistic errors, variability, and ambiguity to allow users to reason about real data instead of curated answers. 

<!-- Math and literacy gaps are the hidden blockers to technology adoption. Half of teachers reported their learners struggling with algebra in labs; nearly a third cited reading barriers. They want tech that dynamically simplifies text, provides just-in-time scaffolds, and links visualizations to equations—so teams can stay focused on the mechanism rather than decoding instructions. -->

For complex systems, users can often get bogged down due to lacks in prior knowledge. Experts cited having technologies that can build sense-making and dynamic translations can help users focus on the main objective.

Technology should help users visualize the application of learning and training. Teachers repeatedly emphasized that experiential learning is most powerful when participants can see relevance beyond the specific scenario. While content mastery is important, many described their ultimate goal as helping people begin reasoning and thinking critically about the topic. They feel technology can help connect the curated experiences to everyday context.

Interactive technologies need to be more customizable. Nearly all experts reported adapting labs to their needs, but most platforms lock them into rigid representations (e.g., generic  models or mismatched notation). Because each usecase is rarely “one-size-fits-all,” stakeholders need the agency to adapt technology just as easily as they customize slide decks.

## Summary of Design Guidelines  

Overall, technology should support authentic, hands-on laboratory practices while scaffolding prior knowledge so mixed-experienced users can contribute. Easily customizable technology is essential for widespread adoption.

    <b>Summary of Findings and Design Guidelines:</b>
    Overall, technology should support authentic, hands-on laboratory practices, while also scaffolding prior knowledge
    to be accessible for users with differing prior skills. Allowing teachers to customize technology
    is also important, as they can best adapt it to suit their specific context.

Technologies for science environments often fail not because of weak pedagogy, but because they overlook organizational contexts, human diversity, and laboratory realities. By centering these perspectives, this study argues for a shift toward tools that prioritize adaptability, contextual responsiveness, and user agency.
