Extended reality (XR)—including Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)—is often pitched as the future of training. Beyond the hype, we examined what actually makes XR worth considering when learning at a distance. This paper highlights strengths and challenges with using XR for online education and training.


## Shared Presence

Social presence matters. Users often report feeling “disconnected” in online enviroments. XR environments can replicate the quality of face-to-face interaction—VR rehearsals show no drop in communication effectiveness compared to in-person sessions .

However, seamless interaction is still unsolved. XR helps with presence, but face and eye tracking remain limited. Facilitators must plan around these gaps, not assume XR “solves” distribution automatically.

## Engagement and Focus

Motivation often drops in online formats. AR books and mobile AR apps have demonstrated improved attention and enjoyment, while VR simulations foster exploration and active learning. In some controlled studies, users gleaned more from a VR field deployment than from the real experience because VR allowed perspectives (like aerial overviews) that were impossible on-site. However, balancing stimulation is critical—too little or too much visual input can hinder focus.

## Comprehension and Information Retention

Studies reveal XR enhances conceptual visualization, memory, and knowledge acquisition compared to video or text alone. AR excels at overlaying instructions, diagrams, or abstract concepts directly onto physical objects, cutting task time and increasing accuracy. For distributed operations, this means users can rehearse lab-like work remotely with clear guidance.

## Builder Resources

Facilitators cite inflexibility as a barrier to adoption. Teams need flexible, no-code tools to adapt XR walkthroughs to their own procedures. Without them, XR risks being an expensive demo rather than a daily operations tool. New platforms like ARTutor and ComposeAR show promise in enabling non-programmers to create or adapt AR content, while VR tools remain harder to customize. Making content creation accessible is key to large-scale integration.

## Future Research Directions

Key areas include:
* Hardware advancement – lighter, more comfortable headsets.
* Software improvement – user-friendly design tools, hand/eye tracking for precision interactivity.
* Scalability – leveraging technologies like 5G to support large-scale operations.
* Health concerns – addressing motion sickness, eye strain, and fatigue in extended sessions.
