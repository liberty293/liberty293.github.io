Advances in augmented reality (AR) can help elicit latent variables underlying dynamic systems. Using a simple pendulum experiment as our research context, I created an AR interface displaying pendulum angle, energy flow graphs, and real-time state information. When using these system, users can view kinetic, potential, and thermal energy transformations, uncertainies, and damping coefficients that are usually buried in spreadsheets. Compared to a traditional setup, teams equipped with AR noticed subtle data differences faster, and articulated causal explanations with greater confidence. Results from a between-participant study (n=52) show the AR instrumentation strengthened scientific reasoning (Bayes factor 17.44), pointing to how immersive analytics can support deeper system understanding.

## Concept and Design

The AR system was developed as a mobile application layered over a **real physical pendulum**. It was designed to act as a cognitive aid by embedding measurement tools and visualizations directly in the experimental space:  

- **AR Protractor** – Anchored at the pivot point, a semi-transparent digital protractor displayed the pendulum’s angle in real time, along with the instrument’s uncertainty.  
- **Energy Graph** – A dynamic visualization showing the flow of potential, kinetic, and dissipated energy during motion, making normally abstract energy concepts visible.  
- **Period Counter** – Automated timing of oscillations, with both total counts and average periods, relieving participants from hand-counting and reducing measurement error.  
- **Lab Notebook Interface** – A paired digital notebook that stored results, computed statistics (including t-tests), and displayed uncertainty values alongside measured data.  

By combining real instruments with AR overlays, the system was designed to reduce extraneous cognitive load, support distributed cognition across digital and physical artifacts, and provide meta-representations that connect abstract physics concepts with real-time measurements.


## Results

The results showed that AR-enhanced labs led to significantly greater improvements in scientific reasoning than traditional lab setups. Bayesian analysis produced a Bayes Factor of 18.11 favoring the AR condition, with a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.63), indicating that participants using AR gained more from the experience. Teams in the AR condition engaged more deeply with latent variables: they were more likely to notice differences in energy dissipation, reference uncertainty in their reasoning, and trust their results. Energy transfer emerged as a particularly salient concept, with AR participants twice as likely to mention it as an insight compared to the control group. While both groups grasped the main physics concept—that larger angles affect pendulum period—the AR group showed stronger reasoning about why this was the case.

The findings suggest AR can act as a cognitive partner in instrumented labs, shifting attention from procedural demands to to critical evaluation of evidence—an approach that translates directly to diagnosing complex mechanical systems.
