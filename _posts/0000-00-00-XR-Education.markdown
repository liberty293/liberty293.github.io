## Immersive Analytics
### Tracking Energy in Pendulums
I use augmented reality (AR) to elicit latent phenomena underlying physical systems. Using a simple pendulum system as a research context, we show how providing real-time energy visualizations and cognative artifiacts (e.g., digital protractors and automatic period counters) help people gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving real pendululm behavior. Our real-time  reduces cognitive overhead and reveals relationships between angle, energy transfer, and damping that are otherwise buried in graphs spreadsheets. In a comparative study (n=52), teams using the AR overlays could better reason about the system data and uncertainty analysis (Bayes factor 17.44), as well as were more likely to bring in latent variables when describing system behavior.

### XR for Distance Education
With the rise of distance learning and online training, many educators are seeking new technological solutions to aid in the learning process. As a result, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies have gained traction as potential avenues for remote education. In this paper, we outline the current methods for online learning, as well as the educational and technical challenges that accompany them. We then summarize prior relevant attempts that leverage AR and VR technologies for educational purposes, evaluate the advantages of AR and VR in an educational context as a whole, and finally assess their limitations as possible avenues for further research.

### Location-Based Outdoor Learning
Outdoor learning experiences, such as field trips, can improve children’s science achievement and engagement, but these experiences are often difficult to deliver without extensive support. Narrative in educational experiences can provide needed structure, while also increasing engagement. We created a narrative-based, mobile application to investigate how to guide young learners in interacting with their local, outdoor environment. In a second variant, we added augmented reality and image classification to explore the value of these features. A study (n = 44) found that participants using our system demonstrated learning gains and found the experience engaging. Our findings identified several major themes, including participant excitement for hands-on interactions with nature, curiosity about the characters, and enthusiasm toward typing their thoughts and observations. We offer a set of design implications for supporting narrative-based, outdoor learning with immersive technology.

### AR Flashcards
Memorizing terminology is tedious, but necessary for many task performances. This prototype shows two ways AR transforms static flashcards into spatial memory games. Users can import domain taxonomies (or author their own), then manipulate holographic components and scenario prompts that anchor knowledge to spatial cues—useful for onboarding complex workflows.

## Augmented Reality
### Diagnosing Unseen Robot Errors - Lam Research

Many robots need to be run in opaque boxes for safety and to reduce contamination. However, when this makes it difficult to diagnose and attend to errors when the robot malfunctions. Augmented reality can help engineers visualize robotic information that previously was shown as numbers on a screen. This provides for faster diagnosis and better intuition for robotic maintenance and manipulation.

## Insight Frameworks
### Instructors' Perspectives on Lab Technologies
Hands-on learning and training is critical for assisting in gaining both the psychomotor and mental skills needed for success. While these opportunities can be difficult to do at scale, most technological solutions put learners in front of a screen or remove the realistic, physical aspects of the experience. Using science labs as a reseach context, we investigate how educators view technology for hands-on learning. Through school visits (n=7), surveys (n=58), and interviews (n=18) spanning diverse socioeconomic and domain contexts, we investigate how teachers envision technology's role in science labs. We identify mismatches between existing technologies and classroom realities. Many technologies focus on showing abstract concepts and "perfect" simulations, while teachers favored students learning the "ways of science'' (e.g., lab skills, designing experimental methods) and grappling messiness of empirical data. Typically, teachers modify traditional labs to meet diverse student needs. However, todays technologies but lack this flexibility. We therefore argue for moving beyond pure technical sophistication towards pedagogy-based technologies that empower instructors and promote accessible learning. In this work, we contribute actionable design guidelines towards hands-on technologies emphasizing customization, preservation of hands-on experiences, and real-world knowledge transfer.

### Thermodynamics
This simulation provides an interactive demonstration of the relationship between temperature, pressure, and entropy. Users manipulate the vapor dome (a 3D map of the relationships) and see how it generates the 2D graphs typically used in thermodynamic analysis. The tool is deployed at the University of Maryland to align researchers around the same mental model of phase-change behavior.
